# PurposeThe purpose of this project is to create an open GUI for 5dchess engines. The Gui will be a functional game, however it is still recommended to use the steam implementation of the game for competitive, and casual play. The main purpose of the project is to interface with engines, so engine developers do not have to develop a specific GUI for their engine. This GUI may also facilitate engine v. engine matches, as well as puzzles.## Proposed Features*  :white_check_mark:  GUI for 5d Chess* % Ability to load games from a FEN like format* % Ability to Make, Load Puzzles from FEN* :x: Ability to interface with 5d Engines in a UCI like protocol* :x: Human V. Bot and Bot V. Bot Matches.Key:1. :x: not started2. - not finished3. % WIP4. :white_check_mark: finished# NotationShad's notation has been chosen as the standard notation for 5d chess going foreward. I am in the process of porting this GUI to that notation. You can read the specification of this notation here: <https://github.com/adri326/5dchess-notation/blob/master/README.md>## old notationThis is the old notation that my GUI previously used, currently I am porting the Notation to Shad's notationThis GUI uses a custom raw notation, dissimilar to other notations developed by other 5dChess community members. This notation is not meant to be human readable, but rather meant for an engine. I have dubbed this notation __**Coordinate Notation**__.In a 2d chess engine, you may notice that moves are denoted in long algebraic notation _ie_. > e2e4In this gui, notation for a move will look like>(x<sub>origin</sub>,y<sub>origin</sub>,T<sub>origin</sub>,L<sub>origin</sub>)(x<sub>dest</sub>,y<sub>dest</sub>,T<sub>dest</sub>,L<sub>dest</sub>)With x being the file, y being rank, T being time, and L being Layer/Timeline.A whole Turn will look like>(x<sub>M1o</sub>,y<sub>M1o</sub>,T<sub>M1o</sub>,L<sub>M1o</sub>)(x<sub>M1d</sub>,y<sub>M1d</sub>,T<sub>M1d</sub>,L<sub>M1d</sub>);(x<sub>M2o</sub>,y<sub>M2o</sub>,T<sub>M2o</sub>,L<sub>M2o</sub>)(x<sub>M2d</sub>,y<sub>M2d</sub>,T<sub>M2d</sub>,L<sub>M2d</sub>)â€¦With moves separated by semicolons. A promotion would look like> (x<sub>origin</sub>,y<sub>origin</sub>,T<sub>origin</sub>,L<sub>origin</sub>)(x<sub>dest</sub>,y<sub>dest</sub>,T<sub>dest</sub>,L<sub>dest</sub>)=Qand castling is denoted normally, with layer added> &lt;MOVE&gt;;O-O,L;&lt;MOVE&gt;Lastly, there may be the need to show a null move, which is denoted as:> 0000Formally, the moves should follow an order where destination layer is from top to bottom however this is not enforced by the engine. Branching moves must always be ordered how they occur however.# UCIThis project will eventually implement a protocol to interface with engines. I am now considering UCI and looking at the referece <https://www.stmintz.com/ccc/index.php?id=360181>.The UCI will probably use some form of shads notation, or perhaps Coordinate notation for moves.# FENThis project Is currently being ported to the new FEN standard -- in the meantime, my GUI uses the following format## Old FEN notationThis project will use a custom FEN format to load gamestates into the GUI/ into the engines.The format that is used is based off of the FEN format with some tweaks. The starting position in normal fen is: > rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1with each field separated by whitespace. Read more about Fen at the wiki page:<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation>You can find out more about the format in this google doc <https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ER6cLA31S-MZYTma7KutqR2AbqPuMjxY5F-dUCMhxQ/edit> -- It is not final however.In the future I may add functionality to specify mate in x with a puzzle. Puzzles will not be viable however until there is an engine that can make correct defensive/offensive refutations of certain moves. One workaround would be able to specify a refutation table for each possible move, however this may be tedious for puzzle makers.##Examplesexample of this format can be found in the /res/ and /res/variations/ folders.# Other Projects and resources**The Best Resource for 5d Chess Programming is AlexBay's Discord Channel: <https://discord.gg/KP5vApW>**Original 5d Implementation on steam: <https://5dchesswithmultiversetimetravel.com/>There are several other open source projects that are also being worked on:Alexbay's GitLab:<https://gitlab.com/alexbay218/5d-chess-js>Alexbay's 5dChess:<https://chessin5d.net/#/>Shad's Engine:<https://github.com/adri326/5dchess-tools/>L0laapk3 5dChess website: <https://multiversechess.com/># NotesThis project is being developed using eclipse, all source code is in the src folder. I will periodically export the code as a jar file. This project uses Javafx, which has caused issues in the past.# CopyrightThis engine was made without reference to source or decompiled code from the software "5d Chess With Multiverse Time Travel" developed by LLC. Thunkspace. This project simply recreates ideas presented within the game, And therefore does not violate copyright as game rules are non copyrightable.All sprites within the game are created by me.
