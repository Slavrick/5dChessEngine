# PurposeThe purpose of this project is to create an open GUI for 5dchess engines. The Gui will be a functional game, however it is still recommended to use the steam implementation of the game for competitive, and casual play. The main purpose of the project is to interface on engines, so that engine developers do not have to make a GUI visualize their engines.## Proposed Features* - GUI for 5d Chess* - Ability to load games from a FEN like format* - Ability to Make, Load Puzzles from FEN* :x: Ability to interface with 5d Engines in a UCI like protocol* :x: Human V. Bot and Bot V. Bot Matches.Key:1. :x: not started2. - not finished3. % WIP4. :white_check_mark: finished# Custom raw notationThis engine will use a custom raw notation. Raw notation is not meant for human readers but rather for an engine. You will notice in 2d chess, the raw notation used by engines is in the form of something like > e4e5In this engine, notation for a move will look like>(x<sub>origin</sub>,y<sub>origin</sub>,T<sub>origin</sub>,L<sub>origin</sub>)(x<sub>dest</sub>,y<sub>dest</sub>,T<sub>dest</sub>,L<sub>dest</sub>)With x being the file, y being rank, T being time, and L being Layer/Timeline.A whole Turn will look like>(x<sub>M1o</sub>,y<sub>M1o</sub>,T<sub>M1o</sub>,L<sub>M1o</sub>)(x<sub>M1d</sub>,y<sub>M1d</sub>,T<sub>M1d</sub>,L<sub>M1d</sub>);(x<sub>M2o</sub>,y<sub>M2o</sub>,T<sub>M2o</sub>,L<sub>M2o</sub>)(x<sub>M2d</sub>,y<sub>M2d</sub>,T<sub>M2d</sub>,L<sub>M2d</sub>)â€¦With moves separated by semicolons. A promotion would look like> (x<sub>origin</sub>,y<sub>origin</sub>,T<sub>origin</sub>,L<sub>origin</sub>)(x<sub>dest</sub>,y<sub>dest</sub>,T<sub>dest</sub>,L<sub>dest</sub>)=Qand castling is denoted normally, with layer added> &lt;MOVE&gt;;O-O,L;&lt;MOVE&gt;Formally, the moves should follow an order where destination layer is from top to bottom however this is not enforced by the engine. Branching moves must always be ordered how they occur however.# Other Projects and resourcesThere are several other projects and programs that will probably surpass this one.Original 5d Implementation on steam: <https://5dchesswithmultiversetimetravel.com/>Alexbay's GitLab:<https://gitlab.com/alexbay218/5d-chess-js>Alexbay's 5dChess:<https://chessin5d.net/#/>Alexbay's Discord Channel:<https://discord.gg/KP5vApW>Shad's Engine:<https://github.com/adri326/5dchess-tools/>Hexicubes Viewer:<https://github.com/Hexicube/5D-Chess-Game-Viewer>L0laapk3 5dChess:<https://multiversechess.com/># Notes# CopyrightThis engine was made without reference to source or decompiled code from the software "5d Chess With Multiverse Time Travel" developed by LLC.
